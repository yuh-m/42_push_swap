# Push Swap

## Key learnings
 - Sorting algorithm 
 - Linked lists

## About
 - Objective sort a list of integers in stack A, with the smallest number being on top. While aiming to complete with a minimum number of moves, and following a set of movement rules
   - Starting
     - stack A contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers
which cannot be duplicated 
     - stack B is empty

   - Allowed operations - on stack X
     - sX - Swap the first two elements at the top of stack
	 - pX - Push first element at the top of one stack and put at the top of the other
	 - rX - Shift **up** all elements of a stack by one (the element on top becomes the last on)
	 - rrX - Shift **down** all elements of a stack by one (the element on bottom becomes the first on) 
	 - ss - apply swap to both stack
	 - rr - apply rotate to both stack
	 - rrr - aplly reverse rotate to both stack
